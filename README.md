# Remote DLL Injection

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept implementation of remote DLL injection in Windows systems. It includes a Python script that performs the DLL injection and a sample DLL that displays a "Hello World" message box when injected.

⚠️ **WARNING: Educational Purpose Only**
This code is for educational purposes only. Improper use of DLL injection techniques can be harmful and may be illegal if used maliciously. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing on any system.

## Components

- `remote_dll_injection.py`: The main Python script that performs the DLL injection
- `hello_world.c`: A sample DLL that displays a message box when injected

## Technical Overview

The project implements DLL injection through the following steps:

1. Allocates memory in the target process
2. Writes the DLL path to the allocated memory
3. Creates a remote thread to load the DLL using LoadLibrary

## Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio (for compiling the DLL)
- Windows SDK
- Administrative privileges

## Dependencies

Python dependencies:
- ctypes (built-in)

## Usage

1. Compile the `hello_world.c` to create `hello_world.dll`
2. Modify the `pid` variable in `remote_dll_injection.py` to target the desired process
3. Run the script with administrative privileges:

```bash
python remote_dll_injection.py
```

## Code Structure

### Python Script (`remote_dll_injection.py`)
- Uses Windows API through ctypes
- Implements process memory manipulation
- Creates remote threads for DLL loading

### DLL (`hello_world.c`)
- Simple DLL that displays a message box on attachment
- Uses Windows API for GUI interaction

## Security Considerations

- Always verify the target process ID
- Use in controlled environments only
- Be aware of system security implications
- Never inject DLLs into critical system processes
